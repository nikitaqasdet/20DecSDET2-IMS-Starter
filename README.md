# Project Title

IMS Fundamentals, with strong starting source-code to allow for easier database management and development - first real java project


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Java Eclipse IDE, from (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) - make sure you have the latest version of Java installed already
Git, from (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
MySQL, from (https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) (may require payment/sponsorship)
Apache Maven, from (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Ensure that you have also configured your Disk Management and Pathways


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

You can either run tests manually and check for coverage using the run engine/console within Eclipse IDE or by utilising online resources such as sonarqube to automatically detect errors in your code, helping it to read better


### Unit Tests 

Maven Coverage - with each line of code you run, this feature increses the coverage for your programme as a whole, showing which elements of your programme/database were able to be successully tested and which still need to be worked on


### Integration Tests 
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

Integrations refer to how the different classes all become integrated into a central product/programme, in this case the database tables. The CRUD functionalities allow us as developers to take code that back-end looks like it works quite differently between classes, to achieve similar results, while still allowing them to be spread out amongst classes, often for data protection purposes.


### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Sonarqube is an extremely powerful tool for this, and uses code "smalls" to identify and help eliminate any spaghetti/unreadable code within your programme - allows for this code to be picked up easier by other developers, and for the best practice and design patterns to be observed across the industry
